# H1 Final Reflection

Before starting on this project, I went over my UX design hi-fi wireframe I created in Adobe XD. I went through it and made notes on how to acheive certain elements using code. While working on this project, I encountered some challenges regarding the images on the website. When I inserted images into my website, they showed up too large for the screen. I fixed this problem by resizing the images using css and posiitoning them in their proper areas.

I also encountered some difficulties with making images responsive to screen sizes, I fixed this issue by reviewing course material and looking at W3Schools.

All images made by me, bootstrap and font awesome used.
